# Lizard-Tail-Wallet
This project is meant to create an app that self destructs when entering the wrong password to store the private key at home, the user will need a second USB stick containing the private key and hidden in the middle of the desert if you will. This way when the USB stick is breached it will self destruct and the  user has his safe key stored somewhere else (for example at a bank treasure box).
